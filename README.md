# K-neighbour-estimator

The Kth nearest neighbour estimator finds the number of K points closest in distance to a given point and predicts the label from these.
A sample of 2D or 3D data is needed to run the script e.g., x and y or x, y and z coordinates.

In my case, I apply the method to a huge sample of galaxies with three coordinates e.g., x=right ascension, y=declination, z=redshift.
